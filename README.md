## 🚀 Project Overview
Conversational SQL is an AI-powered application that enables users to interact with databases using natural language. By leveraging **Gemma 3 (4B)** as the LLM and **SQLite** as the database, this tool translates user queries into SQL, executes them, and returns results in a chat-based UI built with **Streamlit**.

## 🔥 Features
- **Natural Language to SQL**: Converts human-readable queries into SQL statements.
- **Automated Query Execution**: Runs the generated SQL queries on an SQLite database.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive chat-based UI.
- **Error Handling**: Detects and suggests corrections for invalid queries.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **LLM**: Gemma 3 (4B)
- **Database**: SQLite
- **Frontend**: Streamlit

## 📦 Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/conversational-sql.git
   cd conversational-sql
   ```
2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```sh
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the application:
   ```sh
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## 🏗️ Usage
1. Start the Streamlit app.
2. Enter a natural language query, e.g., _"Show the top 5 customers by sales"_.
3. The system converts the query into SQL and executes it.
4. View results directly in the chat interface.

## 🚀 Future Enhancements
- Add support for multiple database backends (PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.)
- Improve SQL optimization and query explanations
- Implement authentication for secure database access
